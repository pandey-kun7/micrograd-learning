# 👋 Hey there!

I've been diving into **Neural Networks** and **Deep Learning** lately, exploring various resources — and one of the most insightful has been **[Andrej Karpathy's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy)** 🎥.

Among his amazing playlists is a deep-dive into building neural nets from scratch, which inspired me to replicate his project — **Micrograd** 🧠⚙️

## 🔍 What I’ve Learned

By building and experimenting with Micrograd, I’ve gained hands-on experience and understanding of:

- 🔁 **Backpropagation**
- 📉 **Gradient Descent**
- 🧱 **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)**
- 💪 And most importantly — **motivation to keep learning**!

## 📁 Repository Overview

Although the repo is minimal, here's a quick overview to help you navigate:

- `📜 requirements.txt` — Lists all required dependencies  
- `📓 MicroGrad.ipynb` — The main Jupyter Notebook with full code and explanation

That’s it! Simple, clean, and built for learning 🚀
